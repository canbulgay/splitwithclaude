# Splitwise MVP Usability Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive usability analysis of the Splitwise MVP reveals several critical issues that significantly impact user experience. While the application demonstrates solid foundational architecture and responsive design, there are major navigation and functionality problems that prevent users from accessing core features.

### Key Findings:

- **Critical**: Navigation routing is broken - Expenses page redirects to Dashboard
- **Critical**: Settlements page displays "Failed to load settlements" error
- **Critical**: Quick action buttons don't trigger expected functionality
- **Positive**: Authentication flow works correctly
- **Positive**: Groups page and Create Group functionality work well
- **Positive**: Mobile responsiveness is excellent
- **Positive**: Dashboard displays comprehensive information

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Authentication & Initial Experience ✅

**Status**: Working correctly

The login flow works seamlessly:

- Clean, professional login interface
- Proper credential validation
- Successful JWT token handling
- Smooth redirect to dashboard post-login

### 2. Dashboard Analysis ✅

**Status**: Mostly functional with minor issues

The dashboard effectively displays:

- **StatsCards**: Total Groups (1), Total Expenses (690.00), You Owe (160.00), You Are Owed (185.00)
- **PendingSettlements**: Shows "All caught up!" status appropriately
- **Your Balance Summary**: Clear visual representation with red/green indicators
- **Recent Activity**: Displays expense history with proper timestamps
- **Expenses by Category**: Visual pie chart showing category breakdown
- **Your Groups**: Shows group cards with member counts and total expenses

**Issues Identified**:

- Quick action buttons in dashboard don't trigger expected modals
- Some redundant UI elements (duplicate quick actions)

### 3. Navigation Flow Analysis ❌

**Status**: Critically broken

**Major Issue**: Navigation routing is fundamentally broken:

- Clicking "Expenses" link redirects back to Dashboard
- URL changes to `/expenses` but content remains Dashboard
- This prevents users from accessing the core expense management functionality

**Working Navigation**:

- Dashboard → Groups: ✅ Works correctly
- Dashboard → Settlements: ✅ Works but shows error
- Dashboard → Dashboard: ✅ Works correctly

**Broken Navigation**:

- Dashboard → Expenses: ❌ Redirects to Dashboard
- Any attempt to access `/expenses` directly: ❌ Shows Dashboard content

### 4. Core Feature Pages Analysis

#### Groups Page ✅

**Status**: Fully functional

- Clean interface showing group cards
- "Create Group" button opens modal correctly
- Modal has proper form validation
- Group details display correctly (2 members, 5 expenses, $690.00 total)
- Admin role is properly indicated

#### Expenses Page ❌

**Status**: Inaccessible due to routing issues

- Cannot access via navigation
- Direct URL navigation fails
- This is a critical failure for the core application feature

#### Settlements Page ❌

**Status**: Accessible but broken

- Page loads correctly
- **Critical Error**: "Failed to load settlements" displayed prominently
- Settlement History shows "No settlements recorded yet"
- "Record Settlement" button is present but functionality untested due to API error

### 5. Quick Actions Analysis

| Button Name                 | Location            | Current State  | Issue                 | Fix Required    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Add Expense (Header)        | Dashboard top-right | Non-functional | Doesn't open modal    | High Priority   |
| Add Expense (Quick Actions) | Dashboard sidebar   | Non-functional | Doesn't open modal    | High Priority   |
| Create New Group            | Dashboard sidebar   | Non-functional | Doesn't open modal    | Medium Priority |
| New Group (Groups page)     | Groups page         | ✅ Working     | Opens modal correctly | None            |
| Settle Balance              | Dashboard sidebar   | Untested       | Unknown               | Medium Priority |
| Invite Friends              | Dashboard sidebar   | Untested       | Unknown               | Low Priority    |

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness Analysis ✅

**Status**: Excellent

**Mobile (375x667)**:

- Clean hamburger menu implementation
- Proper card stacking
- Readable text sizes
- Appropriate touch targets
- Stats cards display properly in single column

**Tablet (768x1024)**:

- Optimal 2-column layout for stats cards
- Proper spacing and proportions
- All elements remain accessible
- Good use of available screen space

### 7. Settlement Workflow Analysis ❌

**Status**: Cannot be properly tested due to API errors

The settlements page shows a critical error that prevents testing of the "crown jewel" settlement system:

- "Failed to load settlements" error suggests backend API issues
- Cannot test PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED workflow
- Cannot evaluate two-way confirmation process
- Cannot test settlement optimization features

## Code Snippets for Immediate Fixes

### 1. Fix Navigation Issue

```typescript
// apps/web/src/App.tsx - Check routing configuration
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardPage />} />
        <Route path="/expenses" element={<ExpensesPage />} />
        <Route path="/settlements" element={<SettlementsPage />} />
        <Route path="/groups" element={<GroupsPage />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### 2. Add Loading States

```typescript
// Add to components that make API calls
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

// In component JSX:
{
  isLoading && <SkeletonLoader />;
}
{
  error && <ErrorMessage message={error} onRetry={() => fetchData()} />;
}
{
  !isLoading && !error && <ActualContent />;
}
```

### 3. Fix Quick Action Buttons

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx
const handleAddExpense = () => {
  setIsAddExpenseModalOpen(true);
};

return (
  <button
    onClick={handleAddExpense}
    className="flex items-center space-x-2 p-2 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"
  >
    <Plus size={16} />
    <span>Add Expense</span>
  </button>
);
```

## Business Impact Assessment

### Revenue Impact

- **High**: Broken navigation prevents users from adding expenses (core functionality)
- **High**: Settlement system failure prevents payment resolution
- **Medium**: Poor UX may reduce user retention and referrals

### User Satisfaction Impact

- **Critical**: Core features inaccessible, causing user frustration
- **High**: Navigation confusion reduces user confidence
- **Medium**: Missing feedback creates uncertainty about actions

### Development Priority

1. **Fix navigation routing** - Enables core feature access
2. **Fix settlements API** - Enables crown jewel functionality
3. **Add error handling** - Improves user experience
4. **Fix quick actions** - Improves user flow efficiency

---

## Conclusion

The Splitwise MVP demonstrates strong architectural foundations and excellent mobile responsiveness, but critical navigation and API issues prevent users from accessing core functionality. The immediate priority should be fixing the routing system and settlements API to restore basic application functionality.

The application shows promise with good design patterns and comprehensive feature planning, but requires immediate attention to these blocking issues before it can provide value to users.

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Fix navigation routing as highest priority
2. Resolve settlements API issues
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add user feedback mechanisms
5. Conduct thorough testing of fixed functionality

Once these critical issues are resolved, the application will be well-positioned to deliver on its promise of "building for relationships, not transactions."
