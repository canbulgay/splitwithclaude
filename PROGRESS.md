- [x] Performance impact assessed (optimized algorithms with proper database indexing)

### Technical Debt and Known Issues

**New Technical Debt:**

- Settlement creation workflow not yet implemented (planned for Phase 9)
- Balance caching not implemented for high-frequency operations (future optimization)
- Real-time WebSocket updates not implemented (future enhancement)

**Outstanding Issues:**

- None critical (all core balance functionality working correctly)
- Future enhancement: Advanced balance analytics and reporting
- Future consideration: Multi-currency balance support

**Performance Concerns:**

- Balance calculations optimized for current scale (tested up to 1000+ expenses)
- Settlement optimization algorithm performs well with complex debt scenarios
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing and relationship loading

### Next Steps

**High Priority:**

1. **Start Phase 9: Settlement System** - Implement settlement recording and confirmation
2. **Enhance settlement workflow** - Create settlement creation and tracking system
3. **Add settlement history** - Implement settlement audit trail and history

**Medium Priority:**

1. **Implement real-time updates** - WebSocket integration for live balance updates
2. **Add balance notifications** - Email/push notifications for balance changes
3. **Create balance analytics** - Advanced reporting and balance trend analysis

**Future Considerations:**

- Multi-currency support for international expense tracking
- Balance export functionality (PDF, CSV) for record keeping
- Advanced settlement workflows with approval processes
- Integration with payment processors for automated settlements
