# Splitwise MVP Development Progress

## Current Status

- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20 (Initial Setup)
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Project Foundation Setup
- **Active Branch**: main
- **Next Priority**: Initialize project structure and tooling
- **Development Stage**: Pre-development (Planning & Setup Complete)

## Project Overview

Splitwise MVP is an expense splitting application that helps users track, visualize, and settle shared expenses transparently and automatically. Core focus: minimize awkward money conversations, save time for relationships.

## Quick Status Indicators

- 🔴 **Project Status**: Not yet initialized
- 🟡 **Infrastructure**: Claude setup complete, project setup pending
- 🟡 **Database**: Not configured
- 🟡 **Authentication**: Not implemented
- 🟡 **Core Features**: Not started
- 🟡 **Testing**: Not set up
- 🟡 **Deployment**: Not configured

## Completed Features

### Infrastructure & Setup ✅

- [x] Claude AI development environment configured
- [x] MCP servers (filesystem, context7) set up
- [x] Custom commands created (/start-feature, /review-code, /fix-tests, /update-progress)
- [x] CLAUDE.md project guidelines established
- [x] PROMPT_PLAN.md with 100 structured tasks created
- [x] Development workflow and quality gates defined

### Phase 1: Project Foundation Setup (0/5 completed)

- [ ] 1. Initialize project with pnpm and create base directory structure
- [ ] 2. Set up TypeScript configuration for frontend and backend
- [ ] 3. Configure Vite for React frontend with TypeScript support
- [ ] 4. Set up Express backend with TypeScript and development scripts
- [ ] 5. Initialize git repository with .gitignore and commit conventions

**Next Immediate Task**: Start Phase 1, Task 1 - Initialize project structure

## Current Session Context

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Session Objective**: Initialize project foundation and begin Phase 1 development  
**Active Development**: Ready to begin - all planning and infrastructure complete  
**Files Modified**: CLAUDE.md, PROMPT_PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md (setup files)  
**Tests Added**: None yet (project not initialized)  
**Known Issues**: None (pre-development stage)

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1. **Run `/start-feature "Phase 1: Project Foundation Setup"`**
2. **Initialize project structure** with pnpm workspace
3. **Set up TypeScript** configurations for monorepo
4. **Configure development environment** with Vite and Express
5. **Initialize git repository** with proper conventions

## Architecture Decisions Made

- **Package Manager**: pnpm (better monorepo support, faster installs)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (modern, fast development)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (familiar, flexible)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM (type-safe, developer-friendly)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (comprehensive, secure)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui (utility-first, component library)
- **Testing**: Jest + Testing Library (standard React ecosystem)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

## Technical Debt & Notes

_No technical debt yet - project not started_

**Important Notes**:

- Mobile-first responsive design is critical
- Financial accuracy is paramount - all calculations must be precise
- Security-first approach for all user data and financial information
- Real-time balance updates are a core requirement
- User experience should minimize friction in money conversations

## Environment Status

- ✅ **Claude AI Environment**: Fully configured with MCP servers
- ✅ **Development Commands**: All custom commands ready
- ✅ **Project Planning**: Complete with 100-task roadmap
- ❌ **Local Development**: Not yet set up
- ❌ **Database**: Not configured
- ❌ **Version Control**: Repository not initialized

## Quality Metrics (Targets)

- **Test Coverage**: Target >80% for core functionality
- **Performance**: <2s page load, <200ms API responses
- **Security**: All inputs validated, authorization on every endpoint
- **Mobile**: Responsive design, PWA capabilities
- **Accuracy**: 100% mathematical precision for expense calculations

## Team Context

- **Primary Developer**: Using Claude AI for autonomous development
- **Development Approach**: TDD with comprehensive testing
- **Quality Standards**: Security-first, mobile-responsive, user-centric design
- **Workflow**: Phase-based development with quality gates

## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-01-20 (Planning & Infrastructure)

**Duration**: Setup session  
**Objective**: Establish development infrastructure and planning  
**Accomplishments**:

- Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md with project guidelines
- Established MCP server configuration (filesystem + context7)
- Built custom command workflow (/start-feature, /review-code, etc.)
- Created 100-task PROMPT_PLAN.md with phases and quality gates
- Initialized PROGRESS.md with current project state

**Files Created/Modified**:

- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and standards
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom workflow commands (4 files)
- `PROMPT_PLAN.md` - 100-task development roadmap
- `PROGRESS.md` - This file (session tracking)

**Key Decisions**:

- Chose pnpm for package management
- Decided on React + Express + PostgreSQL stack
- Established mobile-first, security-first development approach
- Created phase-based development workflow

**Next Session Goals**:

- Initialize project structure (Phase 1, Tasks 1-5)
- Set up basic development environment
- Configure TypeScript and build tools
- Begin core application foundation

**Session Quality Check**:

- [x] All planning documentation complete
- [x] Development workflow established
- [x] Technology decisions documented
- [x] Next steps clearly defined
- [x] Claude AI environment fully functional
