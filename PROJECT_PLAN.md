## Technical Debt Tracking

Document any shortcuts or technical debt accumulated:

- **Item**: Description of technical debt
- **Phase**: When it was introduced
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Resolution Plan**: How to address it

## Notes & Best Practices

- Mark each task as complete with [x] after implementation and testing
- Use MCP tools: filesystem for file operations, context7 for latest documentation
- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implement
- Commit after each completed task with conventional commit messages
- Run quality gates after each phase completion
- Update PROGRESS.md after each development session
- Use `/start-feature`, `/review-code`, `/fix-tests` commands as needed
- Always validate expense amounts and authorization before operations
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive design
- Keep UI simple and intuitive - avoid financial jargon
- Focus on user relationships over transactions

## Success Metrics

MVP Success Criteria:

- [ ] Users can create groups and invite members
- [ ] Expenses can be added with multiple split methods
- [ ] Balances calculate correctly in real-time
- [ ] Settlements can be recorded and tracked
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Security measures prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 2s page load)
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for core functionality

## Emergency Procedures

If critical issues arise:

1. Use `/fix-tests` command to address test failures
2. Use `/review-code` for security or quality issues
3. Check PROGRESS.md for recent changes that might have caused issues
4. Run validation checklist to identify specific problems
5. Create hotfix branch for critical production issues
